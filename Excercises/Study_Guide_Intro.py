# Study Guide: Introduction to Python
# This study guide provides a quick-reference summary of what you learned in this lesson and serves as a guide for the upcoming practice quiz.

# In this segment, you learned that Python is a general purpose programming language that is commonly used for scripting and automation, as well as to develop a wide variety of applications. Python is compatible with most operating systems, including Windows, Linux, and Mac OS, and is updated every few years. Python can also run on a variety of machines, such as servers, workstations, PCs, mobile devices, IoT, and more.

# Python is widely used in the IT field, including IT support, system administration, web development, machine learning, data analytics, and more. Python can be used to calculate statistics, run your e-commerce site, process images, interact with web services, and do a whole host of other tasks. Python instructions resemble the English language, which is what makes it easier to learn and understand when compared to other programming languages.

# Python is:

# a general purpose scripting language;

# a popular language used to code a variety of applications;

# a frequently used tool for automation;

# a cross-platform compatible language;

# a beginner-friendly language.

# Python is not:

# a platform-specific / OS-specific scripting language;

# a client-side scripting language;

# a purely object-oriented programming language.


# Code comparison with Python
# You will be learning about both Python and Bash scripting in this program. The following code illustrates a syntax difference between the two languages:

#  Print to screen in Python

#  Print to screen in Bash

# >> print("Hello, how are you?")

# Hello, how are you?

# >> echo Hello, how are you?

# Hello, how are you?


#   Key Terms
# Platform-specific / OS specific scripting language - Platform-specific scripting languages, like PowerShell (for Windows) and Bash (for Linux), are used by system administrators on those platforms.

# Client-side scripting language - Client-side scripting languages, like JavaScript, are used mostly for web programming. The scripts are transferred from a web server to the end-user’s internet browser, then executed in the browser.

# Machine language - Machine language is the lowest-level computer language. It communicates directly with computing machines in binary code (ones and zeros). In binary code, one equals a pulse of electricity and zero equals no electrical pulse. Machine language instructions are made from translating languages like Python into complex patterns of ones and zeros.

# Cross-platform language - Programming language that is compatible with one or more platforms / operating systems (e.g., Windows, Linux, Mac, iOS, Android).

# Object-oriented programming language - In object-oriented programming languages, most coding elements are considered to be objects with configurable properties. For example, a form field is an object that can be configured to accept only dates as input in the mm/dd/yy format, and can be configured to read from and write to a specific database.

# Python interpreter - An interpreter is the program that reads and executes Python code by translating Python code into computer instructions.

# Study Guide: First Programming Concepts
# This study guide provides a quick-reference summary of what you learned in this lesson and serves as a guide for the upcoming practice quiz.

# Functions
# A function is a piece of code that performs a unit of work. In the examples you've seen so far, you have only encountered the print() function, which outputs a message to the screen. You will use this function frequently in this course to check the results of your code. The syntax of the print() function is modeled in the example below.

# 123
# # Syntax for printing a string of text. Click Run to check the result.

# print("Hello world!")
# Reset
# Hello world!
# Keywords
# A keyword is a reserved word in a programming language that performs a specific purpose. In your first Python example, you briefly encountered the keywords for and in.  Note that keywords will often appear in bold in this course.

# In the next few weeks, you will also learn the following keywords:

# Values: True, False, None
# Conditions: if, elif, else
# Logical operators: and, or, not
# Loops: for, in, while, break, continue
# Functions: def, return

# You don't need to learn this whole list now. We'll dive into each keyword as we encounter them. There are additional reserved keywords in Python. If you would like to read about them, please visit the linked “Python Keywords” article in the Resources section at the end of this study guide.

# Arithmetic operators
# Python can calculate numbers using common mathematical operators, along with some special operators, too:

# x + y            Addition + operator returns the sum of x plus y
# x - y             Subtraction - operator returns the difference of x minus y
# x * y            Multiplication * operator returns the product of x times y
# x / y             Division / operator returns the quotient of x divided by y
# x**e            Exponent ** operator returns the result of raising x to the power of e
# x**2            Square expression returns x squared
# x**3            Cube expression returns x cubed
# x**(1/2)    Square root (½) or (0.5) fractional exponent operator returns the square root of x
# x // y           Floor division operator returns the integer part of the integer division of x by y
# x % y          Modulo operator returns the remainder part of the integer division of x by y

# Order of operations
# The order of operations are to be calculated from left to right in the following order:

# Parentheses ( ), { }, [ ]

# Exponents xe   (x**e)

# Multiplication * and Division /

# Addition + and Subtraction -

#  You might find the PEMDAS mnemonic device to be helpful in remembering the order.
