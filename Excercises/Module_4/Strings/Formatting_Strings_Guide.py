# Formatting Strings Guide

# Python offers different ways to format strings. In the video, we explained the format() method. In this reading, we'll highlight three different ways of formatting strings. For this course you only need to know the format() method. But on the internet, you might find any of the three, so it's a good idea to know that the others exist.

# Using the format() method
# The format method returns a copy of the string where the {} placeholders have been replaced with the values of the variables. These variables are converted to strings if they weren't strings already. Empty placeholders are replaced by the variables passed to format in the same order.
